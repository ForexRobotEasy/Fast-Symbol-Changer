# Fast Symbol Changer - Forex Robot Easy

This code is a sample implementation of the Fast Symbol Changer feature developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. It allows traders to quickly switch between different currency pairs and custom symbols for trading operations. 

## Functionality

The code includes the necessary libraries and defines the maximum number of custom symbols and currency pairs. It also initializes arrays to store the currency pairs and custom symbols.

The `initializeCurrencyPairs()` function populates the `currencyPairs` array with a list of currency pairs. Similarly, the `initializeCustomSymbols()` function populates the `customSymbols` array with a list of custom symbols.

The `selectCurrencyPair()` function allows the trader to select a specific currency pair for trading. It sets the selected pair using the `trade.Symbol()` function.

The `selectCustomSymbol()` function allows the trader to select a specific custom symbol for trading. It also sets the selected symbol using the `trade.Symbol()` function.

The `OnStart()` function is the entry point of the program. It initializes the currency pairs and custom symbols using the respective functions. It then demonstrates the usage of the Fast Symbol Changer by selecting the first currency pair and the first custom symbol from their respective arrays.

After selecting the symbols, the code can include additional logic to execute trading operations based on the selected symbol. This can involve placing orders, modifying orders, closing positions, etc.
